Why AI in Testing?
Traditional automation struggles with maintenance, dynamic UIs, and evolving requirements. AI/ML addresses these by:

Recognizing patterns and adapting to GUI changes (self-healing)

Best Practices
Understand AI/ML before applying it‚Äîfoundation first

Start small, with pilot programs, then scale

Use prompt engineering for reliable test generation

Treat AI as a helper‚Äînot a replacement
